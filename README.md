# rappor-go
Go implementation of Google's RAPPOR client.
The code was written as a learning exercise in Go while working on another (somewhat related) project and compiles but was never actually tested or used, so it is possibly flawed.

RAPPOR is google's project for privacy preserving statistics and is used in Chrome, the paper described it can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6981
The original client (in python) that this is based on can be found here: https://github.com/google/rappor/blob/master/client/python/rappor.py

I have no affiliation with Google.
